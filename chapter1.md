# The Current Object, self in Ruby

## Objective

To learn about the current object **self** and the top level context in Ruby.

## Steps

### Step 1

In Ruby, there is always one object that plays the role of current object which is the default receiver. We call it the **self**. Let's see the value of self.


```ruby
puts self
```

This prints: **main**. 

This tells us that Ruby has created an object called **main** for us at the top level. And all the code we write at the top level will use **main** as the receiver in method calls. What is top level? You are in top level when you have not entered into a class or module definition or exited from all class or module definitions.
