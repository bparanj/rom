# Develop Sinatra Clone

## Objective

To apply the basics we learned in the Ruby Object Model article series to develop a Sinatra clone called Chico.

## Steps

### Step 1

```ruby
get '/' do
  'hi'
end
```

If you run this program, you get:

```ruby
NoMethodError: undefined method ‘get’ for main:Object
```

### Step 2

We can open the Object class and define the **get()** method:

```ruby
class Object
  def get(path)
    yield
  end
end

get '/' do
  p 'hi'
end
```

This prints: 

```ruby
hi
```

#### Problems
This method is invoked immediately.
Opening the Object class to add the get method makes it available everywhere.
Step 3
How to mixin a method to top level?

module Kernel

  def get(path)
    yield
  end
end

get('/') do
  p 'hi'
end
This prints 'hi'. Mixing it to the Kernel also makes the get() method available at the top level and the method gets invoked immediately. We can make the get() method private, similar to puts method we encountered in the previous articles.

module Kernel

  private

  def get(path)
    yield
  end
end

get('/') do
  p 'hi'
end
But, it will not solve any of our problems.

Step 4
Let's write the minimal Sinatra application. Create mine.rb:

require 'sinatra'
You can run it like this:

$ruby mine.rb
You can see that the server runs on port 4567. You can stop the server by doing Ctrl+C.

Step 5
How can we accomplish the same? If you read the source code for Sinatra, you will see that it uses atexit hook. Let's use the atexit hook:

at_exit do 
  p 'Chico has taken the stage' 
  begin
    puts "Press Ctrl-C to quit the server"
    loop {}
  rescue Interrupt => e
    puts "Yay! The crowd applauds."
  end
end
Another way to interrupt the Ctrl-C:

Signal.trap('SIGNINT') do

end 
The current implementation for loop method does not do anything. We need to listen for incoming requests and call the corresponding methods defined by the developer. We will discuss it in upcoming articles.

Summary
In this article, we applied the Ruby Object Model basics to develop a Sinatra Clone.
